## Contributions

If you would like to contribute a new SDK, please make sure of the following:

- Your SDK is packaged using osxcross. See [Packaging the SDK on macOS](https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross#packaging-the-sdk) for more details.
- Please only one pull request per SDK (for better tracking and consistency reasons).
- Add an entry in the [SDKs](#sdks) section as well as in [macosx_sdks.json](./macosx_sdks.json) file (follow the *newer/up - older/down* order).
- Provide a link for the preliminary download of your SDK and its [SHA256SUM](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sha256sum) for testing.
- Open a [pull request](https://github.com/joseluisq/macosx-sdks/pulls) and wait for approval. Usually after merging, a new release should be coming right after.

Feel free to file an [issue](https://github.com/joseluisq/macosx-sdks/issues).
